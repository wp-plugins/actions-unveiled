== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q.** Why was this plugin created?

**A.** Because I really had some hard time figuring how some hook were chained, and how my plugin did fit in the big picture. 

**Q.** Do I need that plugin?

**A.** If your a plugin developper, it can be of big help.

**Q.** Nothing appears?!

**A.** Open your javascript console and type *be_mch_actunv()*

**Q.** Still, nothing appears?!

**A.** Maybe your theme's layout hide the hooks tree list (in frontend it is appended at the very bottom of the body) or maybe there's a javascript error breaking this plugin's script(s).

**Q.** Why do I have to call a javascript function (*be_mch_actunv*)?

**A.** Because if your website is already in a production environement, you won't want the hooks tree list to be visible by default getting your end users confused.

**Q.** I don't like the layout! Now what?

**A.** You're a developper, write your own css/javascript and have it overide this plugin "layout".

**Q.** How do I add a message to the hooks tree list?

**A.** Simply add the following php code block with your message:

`if (defined('BE_MCH_ACTUNV')) {
		new BE_MCH_ACTUNV_messenger('<your message>');
	}
`

Note: don't forget the backslash if you're inside a namespace.

`new \BE_MCH_ACTUNV_messenger('<your message>');`
